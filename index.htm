               Endless legends surround the mystery of "La Joconde ".
            Art historians, journalists and enthusiasts have been 
            arguing for decades about what Mona Lisa's smile means,
            is it not a fake that hangs in the Louvre
            and who is depicted in the Leonardo’s masterpiece?
            How did it happen that it was “Gioconda” 
            who won the “world championship” among all the works 
            and “art” selfie?

                Try to do the impossible and forget that “Gioconda”
                 is a picture of pictures. What do you see in front of you?
                 A small-sized portrait of a not very beautiful and 
                 modestly dressed woman. Why did she press 
                 such strong rivals like Nefertiti, Raphael's Sistine Madonna,
                 or Venus in front of a mirror by Velasquez on the podium of honor?
                 To answer this question, it is not enough to know 
                 the milestones of the Mona Lisa's victorious path to world fame.
                 It is much more important to understand not “how it was,” 
                 but “why it happened.” That is to understand this mechanism.

                  Most people are sure that the portrait of Leonardo is Mona Lisa,
                  wife of Francesco del Giocondo.Hence the second name of 
                  the painting - “Gioconda”. The real Mona Lisa got married 
                  at sixteen for a widower who is much older than her, 
                  who had buried two wives by that time. 
                  She lived the mundane of a noblewoman married just for money
                  to someone her parents had chosen.

                 Another contribution to the romantic aura that surrounds “Gioconda” is
                  a play about a  touching love story that happened at first sight between 
                  the genius Leonardo and his model. Its author of it is
                  the great visionary Jules Verne.In his early play "The Mona Lisa" 
                  he portrayed her as a  mistress of the great Florentine.
                  Thus, in the minds of reading Europe, a love triangle arose-
                  a young handsome artist, an old merchant husband,
                  and a beautiful Gioconda. And no one cared 
                  that in reality Mona Lisa’s husband was much younger 
                  than Leonardo, and the artist himself was persecuted for homosexuality.

                    Second only to the mystery of her enigmatic smile
                    is another question that has long fascinated art experts:
                    what happened to Mona Lisa's eyebrows?
                    "If you look closely at Mona Lisa's eye
                     you can clearly see that the cracks around
                    the eye have slightly disappeared,
                    and that may be explained that one day
                     a curator or restorer cleaned the eye,
                     and cleaning the eye removed, probably 
                    removed the eyelashes and eyebrow,"

                On August 21, 1911, an artist came to the Square Salon of the Louvre,
                who decided to write a copy of Mona Lisa. To his surprise, 
                where the painting usually hung, there was a gaping void.
                “Probably visiting the photographers from the weekend, 
                they will bring back soon,” his servants reassured.
                Time passed - the picture did not appear. 
                The artist began to make trouble, and the ministers
                went to hurry the photographers. But they were not
                going to shoot "Mona Lisa." It was not her and 
                the restorers. The security finally realized
                that the picture was stolen.

                The security finally realized that the picture was stolen.
                 A terrible scandal broke out. The director of Louvre 
                 Omol, who only recently boasted that stealing a “Gioconda”
                is like kidnapping Notre Dame, was fired.
                Unexpectedly for all “Mona Lisa” was
                in the center of political battles. 
                France longed for revenge for the defeat that Germany
                inflicted on it in 1870. There was a big European war.

                    The main character in the case of the theft of "Mona Lisa" was not the police,
                    but the press, and she generously repaid the portrait by Leonardo
                   for the opportunity to demonstrate her growing power.
                   Theft of the picture was the first truly world-wide sensation.
                   The press appointed and dismissed the directors of the Louvre
                   and the prefects of the police, decided whether to be a European war or not,
                   and most importantly - fascinated everyone, from aristocrat to commoner, 
                   with endless detective story options: “Who stole Mona Lisa?”

                One of the main suspects was their leader Pablo Picasso. 
                It turned out that his friend, a certain Pierre,
                had stolen for him from the Louvre two ancient stone figurines.
                Picasso considered primitive artists to be the forerunners of the Cubists.
                He always wanted to have their works before his eyes.
                Museums, he considered the tombs of art, where it is hidden from real life.
                he police decided that, having stolen the figurines, the avant-gardists 
                got a taste and decided to get their hands on Leonardo's masterpiece.
                The detectives “appointed” the poet of the Russian
                Empire, Guillaume Apollinaire, as the “leader” of the international
                gang of avant-garde thieves. Belgian Pierre was his secretary.
                The poet became the only person arrested in the Mona Lisa  
               case. To the credit of the police, it must be said that
               she quickly established the innocence of Apollinaire,
               Picasso and their friends to the theft of the Gioconda.

                The only standing trail was found by the most famous 
                French policeman of those years, Alphonse Bertillon.
                 On the frame, he noticed a fingerprint. But the father of
                  the world's first system for identifying criminals 
                 by a combination of the sizes of five parts of the body 
                 hated the main competitor of his methodology - fingerprinting.
                 Bertillon did not even know how to use his find. The clue that could
                 uncover the riddle of the theft was useless. Detectives, 
                 driven by a perturbed public,
                 climbed out of their way, but achieved nothing but mockery and ridicule.

                    Only the death of the Titanic ousted reports of an investigation
                    into the theft of the Gioconda from the front pages of newspapers around the world.
                    And on December 2, 1913 - after more than two years after
                    the disappearance of the painting - the unknown, who identified himself 
                    as Leonard (who was actually called Vincenzo Perugia), offered Florentine antiquarian 
                    Alfredo Gehry to buy from him “Gioconda”. The stranger explained 
                    that his goal - to return to Italy a masterpiece, stolen by Napoleon.
                    Leonard simply did not know that France had bought the painting
                    three hundred years before Napoleon came to power. After some time,
                    he brought a picture from Paris to Florence in a road box with a double bottom.
                    There, littered with dirty shirts and socks, she was seen by a shocked
                    antiquary when he came to the hotel room where the robber stopped. 
                    Leonard was arrested. What he said during interrogations caused 
                    a new scandal.The press played the grand performance:
                    “The Return of“ Mona Lisa ”. For the second time in three years,
                    the picture turned out to be the heroine of a world sensation.

                    Perugia was hiding the "Gioconda" under the mattress.
                    So he slept in the picture for more than two years.

                “Mona Lisa” was shown at exhibitions in Florence, Rome and Milan, and then she returned 
                to France in triumph in a separate compartment of the Milan-Paris express train.
                Perugia received only a year in prison - an Italian court took into account his patriotic motives.
                 During the First World War, he fought bravely, returned as a hero,
                 and lived the life of a small shopkeeper - a painter.
                 After the theft and return of the painting finally became a symbol of the visual arts in general. 
                 The picture turned into a star, and film actresses and opera divas became more popular.
